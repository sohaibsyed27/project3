    <h2>Movie</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>La La Land</li>
      <li>Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The two movies had a strong impact on me. Spider-Man was just a fun movie that I watched with good friends. It had great music as well as a really good plot.</p>
    <p>La La Land on the other hand was a more meaningful movie to me. It had great themes of working towards your dreams and how someone out there can help you achieve those dreams. It could come at the cost of the relationship though</p>
